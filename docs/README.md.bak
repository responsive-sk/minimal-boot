# Minimal Boot Documentation

Welcome to the Minimal Boot documentation. This guide will help you understand, install, and use the Minimal Boot framework.

## What is Minimal Boot?

Minimal Boot is a lightweight, PSR-15 compliant web application framework built on top of Mezzio. It follows Domain-Driven Design principles and provides a clean, modular architecture for building modern web applications.

## Key Features

- **Domain-Driven Design** - Clean separation of concerns with Domain, Application, and Infrastructure layers
- **Modular Architecture** - Self-contained modules with their own handlers, templates, and services
- **Native PHP Templates** - No external template engine dependencies for better performance
- **PSR-15 Middleware** - Full PSR-15 compliance for HTTP message handling
- **Repository Pattern** - Abstracted data access with interface-based design
- **Code Quality** - PHPStan Level 8 and PSR-12 code standards
